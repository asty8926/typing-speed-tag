{=(quotesList):You can fool all of the people some of the time, and some of the people all of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time.|Abraham Lincoln~After you've done a thing the same way for two years, look it over carefully. After five years, look at it with suspicion. And after ten years, throw it out and start all over.|Alfred Edward Perlman~One cannot always live in the palaces and state apartments of language, but we can refuse to spend our days in searching for its vilest slums.|William Watson~A new idea is delicate. It can be killed by a sneer or a yawn; it can be stabbed to death by a quip and worried to death by a frown on the right man's brow.|Charles Brower~I am enthusiastic over humanity's extraordinary and sometimes very timely ingenuities. If you are in a shipwreck and all the boats are gone, a piano top buoyant enough to keep you afloat may come along and make a fortuitous life preserver. This is not to say, though, that the best way to design a life preserver is in the form of a piano top. I think that we are clinging to a great many piano tops in accepting yesterday's fortuitous contriving as constituting the only ends for solving a given problem|R. Buckminster Fuller~Our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power. We have guided missiles and misguided men.|Martin Luther King, Jr.~The first merit which attracts in the pages of a good writer, or the talk of a brilliant conversationalist, is the apt choice and contrast of the words employed. It is indeed a strange art to take these blocks rudely conceived for the purpose of the market or the bar, and by tact of application touch them to the finest meanings and distinctions.|Robert Louis Stevenson~One of the most important things about leadership is that you have to have the kind of humility that will allow you to be coached.|Jim Yong Kim~Anyone can look for fashion in a boutique or history in a museum. The creative person looks for history in a hardware store and fashion in an airport.|Robert Wieder}
