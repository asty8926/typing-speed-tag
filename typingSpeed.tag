And after ten years, throw it out and start all over.|Alfred Edward Perlman~One cannot always live in the palaces and state apartments of language, but we can refuse to spend our days in searching for its vilest slums.|William Watson~A new idea is delicate. It can be killed by a sneer or a yawn; it can be stabbed to death by a quip and worried to death by a frown on the right man's brow.|Charles Brower~I am enthusiastic over humanity's extraordinary and sometimes very timely ingenuities. If you are in a shipwreck and all the boats are gone, a piano top buoyant enough to keep you afloat may come along and make a fortuitous life preserver. This is not to say, though, that the best way to design a life preserver is in the form of a piano top. I think that we are clinging to a great many piano tops in accepting yesterday's fortuitous contriving as constituting the only ends for solving a given problem.|R. Buckminster Fuller~Our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power. We have guided missiles and misguided men.|Martin Luther King, Jr.~The first merit which attracts in the pages of a good writer, or the talk of a brilliant conversationalist, is the apt choice and contrast of the words employed. It is indeed a strange art to take these blocks rudely conceived for the purpose of the market or the bar, and by tact of application touch them to the finest meanings and distinctions.|Robert Louis Stevenson~One of the most important things about leadership is that you have to have the kind of humility that will allow you to be coached.|Jim Yong Kim~Anyone can look for fashion in a boutique or history in a museum.

{=(desc.help):The world's first way to know your Typing Speed with <@235148962103951360>, directly in Discord!

**How to Play**
`1)` Start a test and optionally specify a test type (defaults to `random`) using: ```css
{tag} start [quote|words|random]
``` `2)` Type the quote or words displayed, and send them in chat
`3)` Follow the instructions to stop the test and see your results!

> __Note:__ Keep in mind that the WPM (Words Per Minute) and CPM (Characters Per Minute) values are only indicators and may not reflect the typing speed you reach on online tests.

{=(desc.nerd):You seem interested and curious about more things...

**How do you get my results from these numbers you ask me to paste after starting a test?**
The first value is the total amount of characters in the text, and the second value is called a ["unix"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) value, which returns the current amount of seconds since January 1st, 1970.

The amount of characters is needed for the WPM & CPM calculation, and the unix value is used to return the difference in seconds between when the test was started and when you finished it, which is then used to display the elapsed time.

**Why are my WPM so different and lower than when I do tests on regular websites?**
I dug their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Miodec/monkeytype) and found the formula that the website [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/) uses, which takes the amount of characters and the time in seconds that the test lasted for.
I currently don't exactly know what makes it *that* different, given that I use the exact same formula, minus considering errors/mistakes and accuracy.

**How are my WPM and CPM then calculated?**
From the total amount of characters in the text and the elapsed time of the test in seconds, the CPM formula is as followed:
`CPM = [amount of characters] * (60 / [elapsed time in seconds])`

On [10FF's FAQ](https://10fastfingers.com/faq), they explain that [Wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute#:~:text=the%20definition%20of%20each%20"word"%20is%20often%20standardized%20to%20be%20five%20characters%20or%20keystrokes%20long%20in%20English%2C%5B1%5D%20including%20spaces%20and%20punctuation.) that on average in the English language for the most common words, a word is considered to be composed of approximately 5 keystrokes.
A keystroke represents the amount of keys you press on your keyboard when typing characters. For example, `A` requires that you press `Shift` and the `a` keys, which represent 2 keystrokes.

Knowing this, they divide the amount of CPM by those 5 average keystrokes to get the number of WPM.
`WPM = [CPM / 5]`

**What language was used to create this command?**
A custom-made *light* programming language made specifically for <@235148962103951360> called [TagScript](https://docs.carl.gg/tags-and-triggers/tags-advanced-usage/).

**What do you use to generate my results on an image/banner?**
I use the [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) website, which allows for image generation, overlays and transformations, directly using URL parameters. It is *very* powerful â”€ a lot more than it may first seem to be â”€ although it took me hours of reading their documentation and of practice to figure out most of the things I know about it.
