## :keyboard: Typing Speed Test Tag - Compete with your friends in Discord!

Are you a Typing Speed Enthusiast and want to progress at your own pace or run some tests from time to time without ever leaving Discord?
Compete with your friends and Measure your Words Per Minute (WPM)!
### **Features**
- Choose your Game Mode: `quotes`, `words` or `random` (default)
 - The quotes are predefined in the code (along with their author and source) and can be edited
 - The words are the 500 most-common English words

- See you and your friends' Score in a dynamically-generated image, including Words Per Minute, Characters Per Minute, Time Taken, Total Characters, Full Datetime, Your Username.

- Customizable features in the code upon importing such as: Amount of decimals in the WPM/CPM, Channels/Roles Requirements (to use the tag)

- Substring matching for all subcommands, meaning you can type a shortened version of the command. Example: `!type s q` starts a new test in `quotes` mode

- A `nerd` subcommand for all my fellow nerds willing to understand how calculating WPM works in this tag and in general

- A clickable list of websites to test your Typing Speed outside of Discord
